# stocks-analysis
### Overview of Project: 
In this module we helped Steve create a VBA script that would run his parents' Stock within seconds when analyzing yearly retunns on a yearly basis. 
## Deliverable 1: Refactoring VBA code
We downloaded the Challenge Starter Code and ran the initial macro ran 2017 and 2018 stock with the following timer message box.

1. 2017 Stocks Image 
2. 

# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### The tickerIndex is set equal to zero before looping over the rows. (5 pt).
### Arrays are created for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices (15 pt).
### The tickerIndex is used to access the stock ticker index for the tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices arrays (15 pt).
### The script loops through stock data, reading and storing all of the following values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices (25 pt).
### Code for formatting the cells in the spreadsheet is working (5 pt).
### There are comments to explain the purpose of the code (5 pt).
### The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm workbook match the outputs from the AllStockAnalysis in the module (5 pt).
### The pop-up messages showing the elapsed run time for the script are saved as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png (5 pt).
## Deliverable 2: A written analysis of your results
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
