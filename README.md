### Overview of Project: 
In this module we helped Steve create a VBA script that would run his parents' Stock within seconds when analyzing yearly returns on a yearly basis. 
## Deliverable 1: Refactoring VBA code
We downloaded the Challenge Starter Code and ran the initial macro ran 2017 and 2018 stock with the following timer message box.

Our task was to "refactor" the code, which is to clean up and restructure the code without change the outcome. The following was added to the code;

Create a ticker index as string and set it equal to zero. This allows us to name the array with the number of elements it contained (always considering starting with the number zero). 

We created arrays for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices and stating their counter data types.

## Deliverable 2: Results
The purpose of the refactoring someone else's project is to ensure the sequence makes sense, the selections such as calling out variables arrays and/or loops, and lastly if the iteration of the loop/code is taking place to the end goal. We also want to leave useful comments in case someone in the future needs to brush up the code.
